        <article class="about">
          <p>The Lunar Exploration and Research Division (LERD) is a specialized NASA unit dedicated to the investigation of potential life beyond Earth, particularly beneath the lunar surface. Founded in 2019 in response to recurring unexplained satellite anomalies, LERD operates at the intersection of planetary science and cultural anthropology.</p>
          <p>LERD's mission is to explore, document, and analyze possible biological systems on the Moon. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, the team has pioneered techniques in thermal imaging, remote drilling, and lunar soil analysis that led to the identification of what may be the first extraterrestrial burrowing mammal: <em>Lepus Lunaris</em>.</p>
          <p>We believe that myths and legends from ancient cultures often hold observational truths. Our goal is not just to uncover scientific facts, but to understand their historical and cultural significance, bridging folklore and data to reshape humanity’s relationship with the cosmos.</p>

        <h4 class="about-title">Why We Need You</h4>
        <p>Science alone cannot move this mission forward. We need artists, thinkers, storytellers, and citizen scientists to join our initiative. Every new supporter brings us closer to understanding the truth hidden beneath the Moon’s surface.</p>
        <p>LERD is not just a division. It’s a movement to reclaim wonder, redefine science, and rediscover forgotten truths written in starlight.</p>

        <h4 class="about-title">Our Vision</h4>
        <p>LERD is committed to expanding its exploration beyond the Moon, opening a new chapter in the search for extraterrestrial life. By 2026, our goals include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deploying deep-core drills and autonomous burrow exploration rovers</li>
          <li>Analyzing behavioral patterns of <em>Lepus Lunaris</em></li>
          <li>Collaborating with global citizen scientists to establish the first interspecies communication protocol</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We believe that science and imagination walk hand in hand. Our journey begins where data meets wonder.</p>

        <h4 class="memorial-title">In Memory of Dr. Emily T. Warren</h4>
        <p class="memorial-text">
          Dr. Emily T. Warren was a visionary biologist and lunar ecologist who dedicated her life to understanding extraterrestrial life.
          As a founding member of LERD, she led the first mission to trace the underground tunnel systems possibly inhabited by <em>Lepus Lunaris</em>.
        </p>
        <p class="memorial-text">
          In 2023, during a solo exploration using remote lunar drilling probes, Dr. Warren made the final data transmission confirming the presence of organic burrow residue — just moments before all signals were lost.
        </p>
        <p class="memorial-text">
          Though her body was never recovered, her legacy lives on in every step LERD takes. The first confirmed habitat of <em>Lepus Lunaris</em> has been officially named <strong>“Warren Hollow”</strong> in her honor. Her courage continues to inspire generations of scientists, dreamers, and lunar explorers.
